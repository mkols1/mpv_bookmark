# mpv_bookmark
 mpv script for bookmarking timestamps in a video and jumping between them

# General
My personal use for this was to bookmark timestamps of a show or movie so that I could go back to get screenshots or clips afterwards. More convenient than stopping the show entirely to do that.

#Installation
1. "Win + r" and open "%appdata%\mpv"
2. Drop into 'scripts' folder.

# TODO

actually making it
